## Dependencies

* Python 3.5 or better (py-2 compatibility is possible, though it would be difficult to implement).
* Airflow trunk (via `pip install git+git://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow.git`; `pip install cryptography`), 
due to [this bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1165).
