`airscooter` is a library and command-line utility for creating and executing simple graph-based workflows. A 
lightweight wrapper over [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow), it is designed 
to make workflows involving downloading, extracting, cleaning, and building datasets easily managable, 
reproducible, and triggerable.

Installation is as easy as `pip install airscooter`.
